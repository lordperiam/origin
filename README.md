## About Me

My name is Mosheh Yeroozedek and I cloned this repository from [Mckay](https://www.mckaywrigley.com/).

I'm currently building an exclusive application that will hold a neural mind map that handles a peculiar use case soon to be published.

Follow me on [X](https://x.com/yeroozedek) and subscribe to my [Substack](https://ofeden.substack.com) for more updates on Neurogenesis v1.
